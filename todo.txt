# this text file will hold some of the things I need to do in the game for the future

1. I currently have it so if the block cannot go down, it locks it leaving no time for the
    user to respond. I need to add a delay, so like once it cannot go down, pause for like a second
    then lock the block.

2. The game so far cannot actually be lost. Only way to quit is by force quitting or pressnig q.
    Once the user cannot spawn a block they should lose the game.
